## task_1_upto_layer_15.ipynb
###  This notebook contains simulation starting from single layer circuit to 15 layers circuit.
### all the circuits has been put together by looping over the no. of layers, and finally overall plot of minimum distance as a function of no. of layers in the specific circuit has been shown (no seperate plot for each circuit has been shown here, its in the next one)
### Notebook is also available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/senpinaki222/task-1-layer-15)


## task_1_upto_layer_12_plotted_each_layer.ipynb
### This one contains simulation starting from single layer circuit upto 12 layers circuit.
### Seperate cells has been dedicated for each circuit, where distance calculated after each iteration of optimization process has been printed and plotted also. 
### Finally in the last part, information like minimum distance from all circuits has been put together and plotted as a fucntion of no. of layers in the circuit.
### Notbook is also available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/senpinaki222/task-1-layer-12-plot-each-layer)
